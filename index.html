				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>Hi, I'm Le Birdo, a Lua Scripter based in the UK. I've been on Roblox for 11 years and scripting for 6 years. I have experience in both front-end and back-end Roblox development, including databases using ProfileService, GUIs, attack handlers, and more. I specialize in writing clean and efficient code using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</p>

								<p>I developed an inventory system for the game I am creating, designed to accommodate up to 41,382 items. This limitation is due to the constraints of Roblox datastores, which have a maximum capacity of 4 MB. I made the Inventory system using <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/save-your-player-data-with-profileservice-datastore-module/667805">ProfileService</a> as it provides usefull features and offers a clean efficient way of saving data. I also Created the system in a way that allows all items to have unique data specific to each item such has Unique Ids or custom properties.</p>

								<p>I created a Network Ownership Dragging system using :SetNetworkOwner. I undertook this project with the aim of emulating the Physics gun from Half-Life 2 and thought it would be a good opportunity to try learn something new. This project required me to understand roblox networking and implement it in a way that lets the client request to claim Network Onwnership over parts. I had to protect the remote from exploiters by ensuring that the client can only Own one item at a time.</p>

								<a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/v11-teamcreate-with-avatars/2394609"><h2>Team Create Avatars</h2></a>
								<p>I felt that the Default TeamCreate avatars that roblox uses were quite boring, so I decided to try and make a Plugin that would replace the boring avatar with the Users' roblox Head. I did this by creating the players' heads with all of their accessories. I also had to use collision groups to ensure that the head doesn't interfere with the players' mouse selection. Finally, I found a function to renderStepped that moves the head to the Users Camera CFrame.</p>

								<a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/a2t-animation2table-plugin-v16/2426128"><h2>Animation2Table</h2></a>
								<p>I needed CFrame animation for a project I was working on, so I developed a plugin that allows me to convert a KeyFrameSequence animation into a Lua table. This table can be played using a custom CFrame animation player. You can also use this to create poses, which you can switch through using a custom-made function.</p>
